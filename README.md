# coinflip-gamblers-ruin

One of the first programs I have written. It calculates the number of coinflips a gambler could perform starting at a balance of $3 if each heads flip adds a dollar to their balance, and each tails flip subtracts a dollar from their balance.
The simulation was run through 100 iterations and the minimum and max number of coin flips were observed.
