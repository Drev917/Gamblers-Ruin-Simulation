# Gamblers-Ruin-Simulation

Simple calculation for the number of coinflips (Heads/Tails) a gambler could perform starting at a balance of $3 until they go broke. 
- With each heads flip, a dollar is added to their balance
- With each tails flip, a dollar is subtracted from their balance

The simulation was run through 100 iterations and the minimum and max number of coin flips were observed.

##### 17 total coinflips with a max balance reaching $7
